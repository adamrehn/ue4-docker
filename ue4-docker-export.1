.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "Exporting Installed Builds under Linux"
.sp
Installed Builds of Unreal Engine can be exported to the host system starting with version 4.21.0. Once you have built either the ue4\-minimal or ue4\-full image for the UE4 version that you want to export, you can export it to the host system like so:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
# Example: specify a version without a full image tag (assumes `adamrehn/ue4\-full`)
# Exports the Installed Build from `adamrehn/ue4\-full:4.27.0` to the directory `~/UnrealInstalled` on the host system
ue4\-docker export installed "4.27.0" ~/UnrealInstalled
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
# Example: specify a full image tag
# Exports the Installed Build from `adamrehn/ue4\-minimal:4.27.0` to the directory `~/UnrealInstalled` on the host system
ue4\-docker export installed "adamrehn/ue4\-minimal:4.27.0" ~/UnrealInstalled
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
# Example: use a container image based on ue4\-minimal with a completely different tag
# Exports the Installed Build from `ghcr.io/epicgames/unreal\-engine:dev\-4.27.0` to the directory `~/UnrealInstalled` on the host system
ue4\-docker export installed "ghcr.io/epicgames/unreal\-engine:dev\-4.27.0" ~/UnrealInstalled
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.SS "Exporting Conan packages"
.sp
The Conan wrapper packages generated by \f(CRconan\-ue4cli\fP can be exported from the ue4\-full image to the local Conan package cache on the host system like so:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
ue4\-docker export packages 4.27.0 cache
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.URL "https://conan.io/" "Conan" ""
will need to be installed on the host system for this to work.
To use the exported packages for development on the host system, you will also need to generate the accompanying profile\-wide packages by running the command:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
ue4 conan generate \-\-profile\-only
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
This will require both \f(CRue4cli\fP and \f(CRconan\-ue4cli\fP to be installed on the host system.
