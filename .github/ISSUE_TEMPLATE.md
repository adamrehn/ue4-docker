(The rest of the issue description goes here. If you're reporting a problem with building container images, be sure to include the full output of the `ue4-docker build` command, including the initial output lines that display the command line parameters used to invoke the build. If you're making a feature request, you can remove the template contents entirely, since the `ue4-docker info` output and related information is only needed for helping diagnose and reproduce bugs.)
