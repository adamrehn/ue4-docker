You can build the following images using the xref:ue4-docker-build.adoc[ue4-docker build] command:

- <<ue4-build-prerequisites>>
- <<ue4-source>>
- <<ue4-minimal>>
- <<ue4-full>>

By default, all available images will be built.
You can prevent unwanted images from being built by appending the relevant image-specific flag to the build command (see the *"Flag to disable"* entry for each image below.)

[[ue4-build-prerequisites]]
== ue4-build-prerequisites

**Tags:**

* **Windows containers**: `adamrehn/ue4-build-prerequisites:BASETAG` where `BASETAG` is the xref:advanced-build-options.adoc#windows-base-tag[Windows Server Core base image tag]

* **Linux containers**: `adamrehn/ue4-build-prerequisites:CONFIGURATION` where `CONFIGURATION` is as follows:

** `opengl` if CUDA support is not enabled

** `cudaVERSION` where `VERSION` is the CUDA version if xref:advanced-build-options.adoc#cuda[CUDA support is enabled] (e.g. `cuda9.2`, `cuda10.0`, etc.)

**Dockerfiles:** https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-docker/tree/master/src/ue4docker/dockerfiles/ue4-build-prerequisites/windows/Dockerfile[icon:windows[] Windows] | https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-docker/tree/master/ue4docker/dockerfiles/ue4-build-prerequisites/linux/Dockerfile[icon:linux[] Linux]

**Contents:** Contains the build prerequisites common to all Engine versions.

**Uses:**

* Keep this image on disk to speed up subsequent container image builds.

[[ue4-source]]
== ue4-source

**Tags:**

* `adamrehn/ue4-source:RELEASE` where `RELEASE` is the Engine release number

* `adamrehn/ue4-source:RELEASE-PREREQS` where `RELEASE` is as above and `PREREQS` is the <<ue4-build-prerequisites>> image tag

**Dockerfiles:** https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-docker/tree/master/src/ue4docker/dockerfiles/ue4-source/windows/Dockerfile[icon:windows[] Windows] | https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-docker/tree/master/ue4docker/dockerfiles/ue4-source/linux/Dockerfile[icon:linux[] Linux]

**Contents:** Contains the cloned source code for Unreal Engine, along with its downloaded dependency data.
The ue4-minimal image uses this source code as the starting point for its build.

**Uses:**

* Only needed during the build process.
Afterwards, this image can be removed using `ue4-docker clean --source` to save disk space.

[[ue4-minimal]]
== ue4-minimal

**Tags:**

* `adamrehn/ue4-minimal:RELEASE` where `RELEASE` is the Engine release number

* `adamrehn/ue4-minimal:RELEASE-PREREQS` where `RELEASE` is as above and `PREREQS` is the <<ue4-build-prerequisites>> image tag

**Dockerfiles:** https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-docker/tree/master/src/ue4docker/dockerfiles/ue4-minimal/windows/Dockerfile[icon:windows[] Windows] | https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-docker/tree/master/ue4docker/dockerfiles/ue4-minimal/linux/Dockerfile[icon:linux[] Linux]

**Contents:** Contains the absolute minimum set of components required for use in a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, consisting of only the build prerequisites and an Installed Build of the Engine.

**Uses:**

* Use this image for xref:continuous-integration.adoc[CI pipelines] that do not require ue4cli, conan-ue4cli, or ue4-ci-helpers.

[[ue4-full]]
== ue4-full

**Tags:**

* `adamrehn/ue4-full:RELEASE` where `RELEASE` is the Engine release number

* `adamrehn/ue4-full:RELEASE-PREREQS` where `RELEASE` is as above and `PREREQS` is the <<ue4-build-prerequisites>> image tag

**Dockerfiles:** https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-docker/tree/src/master/ue4docker/dockerfiles/ue4-full/windows/Dockerfile[icon:windows[] Windows] | https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-docker/tree/master/ue4docker/dockerfiles/ue4-full/linux/Dockerfile[icon:linux[] Linux]

**Contents:** Contains everything from the `ue4-minimal` image, and adds the following:

* ue4cli
* conan-ue4cli
* ue4-ci-helpers
* PulseAudio support (Linux image only)
* X11 support (Linux image only)

**Uses:**

* xref:continuous-integration.adoc[CI pipelines] that require ue4cli, conan-ue4cli, or ue4-ci-helpers
* Packaging xref:microservices.adoc[Unreal Engine-powered microservices]
