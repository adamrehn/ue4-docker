WARNING: macOS provides a suboptimal experience when running Linux containers, due to the following factors:
Linux containers are unable to use GPU acceleration via the xref:nvidia-docker-primer.adoc[NVIDIA Container Toolkit].

== Requirements

- 2010 or newer model Mac hardware
- macOS 10.10.3 Yosemite or newer
- Minimum 8GB of RAM
- Minimum 800GB available disk space for building container images

== Step 1: Install Docker CE for Mac

Download and install https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac[Docker CE for Mac from the Docker Store].

== Step 2: Install Python 3 via Homebrew

The simplest way to install Python 3 and pip under macOS is to use the https://brew.sh/[Homebrew package manager].
To do so, run the following commands from a Terminal prompt:

[source,shell]
----
# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----

== Install Python

[source,shell]
----
brew install python
----

== Step 3: Install ue4-docker

Install the ue4-docker Python package by running the following command from a Terminal prompt:

[source,shell]
----
sudo pip3 install ue4-docker
----

== Step 4: Manually configure Docker daemon settings

Use https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/#resources[the Advanced section under the Resources tab of the Docker Desktop settings pane] to set the memory allocation for the Moby VM to 8GB and the maximum VM disk image size to 800GB.
