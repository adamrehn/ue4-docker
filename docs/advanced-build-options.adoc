== General options

=== Specifying Git credentials

The xref:ue4-docker-build.adoc[ue4-docker build] command supports three methods for specifying the credentials that will be used to clone the Unreal Engine Git repository:

- **Command-line arguments**: the `-username` and `-password` command-line arguments can be used to specify the username and password, respectively.

- **Environment variables**: the `UE4DOCKER_USERNAME` and `UE4DOCKER_PASSWORD` environment variables can be used to specify the username and password, respectively.
Note that credentials specified via command-line arguments will take precedence over values defined in environment variables.

- **Standard input**: if either the username or password has not been specified via a command-line argument or environment variable then the build command will prompt the user to enter the credential(s) for which values have not already been specified.

Note that the username and password are handled independently, which means you can use different methods to specify the two credentials (e.g. username specified via command-line argument and password supplied via standard input.)

Users who have enabled https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-two-factor-authentication[Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)] for their GitHub account will need to generate a https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[personal access token] and use that in place of their password.

=== Building a custom version of the Unreal Engine

If you would like to build a custom version of Unreal Engine rather than one of the official releases from Epic, you can specify "custom" as the release string and specify the Git repository and branch/tag that should be cloned.
When building a custom Engine version, **both the repository URL and branch/tag must be specified**:

If you would like to build a custom version of Unreal Engine rather than one of the official releases from Epic, you can specify "custom" as the release string and specify the Git repository and branch/tag that should be cloned.
When building a custom Engine version, **both the repository URL and branch/tag must be specified**:

[source,shell]
----
ue4-docker build custom -repo=https://github.com/MyUser/UnrealEngine.git -branch=MyBranch
----

This will produce images tagged `adamrehn/ue4-source:custom`, `adamrehn/ue4-minimal:custom`, etc.

If you are performing multiple custom builds and wish to differentiate between them, it is recommended to also specify a name for the custom build:

[source,shell]
----
ue4-docker build custom:my-custom-build -repo=https://github.com/MyUser/UnrealEngine.git -branch=MyBranch
----

This will produce images tagged `adamrehn/ue4-source:my-custom-build`, `adamrehn/ue4-minimal:my-custom-build`, etc.

[[exclude-components]]
=== Excluding Engine components to reduce the final image size

Starting in ue4-docker version 0.0.30, you can use the `--exclude` flag when running the xref:ue4-docker-build.adoc[ue4-docker build] command to specify that certain Engine components should be excluded from the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-minimal[ue4-minimal] and xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-full[ue4-full] images.
The following components can be excluded:

- `ddc`: disables building the DDC for the Engine.
This significantly speeds up building the Engine itself but results in far longer cook times when subsequently packaging Unreal projects.

- `debug`: removes all debug symbols from the built images.
(When building Windows containers the files are actually truncated instead of removed, so they still exist but have a size of zero bytes.
This is done for compatibility reasons.)

- `templates`: removes the template projects and samples that ship with the Engine.

You can specify the `--exclude` flag multiple times to exclude as many components as you like.
For example:

[source,shell]
----
# Excludes both debug symbols and template projects
ue4-docker build 4.21.2 --exclude debug --exclude templates
----

=== Enabling system resource monitoring during builds

Starting in ue4-docker version 0.0.46, you can use the `--monitor` flag to enable a background thread that will log information about system resource usage (available disk space and memory, CPU usage, etc.) at intervals during the build.
You can also use the `-interval` flag to override the default interval of 20 seconds:

[source,shell]
----
# Logs system resource levels every 20 seconds
ue4-docker build 4.24.2 --monitor
----

[source,shell]
----
# Logs system resource levels every 20 seconds
ue4-docker build 4.24.2 --monitor
----

[source,shell]
----
# Logs system resource levels every 5 seconds
ue4-docker build 4.24.2 --monitor -interval=5
----

[[exporting-generated-dockerfiles]]
=== Exporting generated Dockerfiles

Since ue4-docker version 0.0.78, the xref:ue4-docker-build.adoc[ue4-docker build] command supports a flag called `-layout` that allows the generated Dockerfiles to be exported to a filesystem directory instead of being built.
In addition, version 0.0.80 of ue4-docker added support for a flag called `--combine` that allows you to combine multiple generated Dockerfiles into a single Dockerfile that performs a https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/[multi-stage build].
You can use these flags like so:

[source,shell]
----
# Exports Dockerfiles for all images to the specified filesystem directory
ue4-docker build 4.25.4 -layout "/path/to/Dockerfiles"
----

[source,shell]
----
# Exports Dockerfiles for all images
ue4-docker build 4.25.4 -layout "/path/to/Dockerfiles"
----

[source,shell]
----
# Exports Dockerfiles for all images and combines them into a single Dockerfile
ue4-docker build 4.25.4 -layout "/path/to/Dockerfiles" --combine
----

Exporting Dockerfiles is useful for debugging or contributing to the development of ue4-docker itself.
You can also use the generated Dockerfiles to build container images independently of ue4-docker, but only under the following circumstances:

- When building Windows container images, you must specify the <<advanced-options-for-dockerfile-generation,advanced option>> `source_mode` and set it to `copy`.
This generates Dockerfiles that copy the Unreal Engine source code from the host filesystem rather than cloning it from a git repository, thus eliminating the dependency on ue4-docker's credential endpoint to securely provide git credentials and allowing container images to be built without the need for ue4-docker itself.

[[advanced-options-for-dockerfile-generation]]
=== Advanced options for Dockerfile generation

NOTE: Note that option names are all listed with underscores between words below (e.g. `source_mode`), but in some examples you will see dashes used as the delimiter instead (e.g. `source-mode`). **These uses are actually equivalent, since ue4-docker automatically converts any dashes in the option name into underscores.** This is because dashes are more stylistically consistent with command-line flags (and thus preferable in examples), but underscores must be used in the underlying Dockerfile template code since dashes cannot be used in https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/api/#notes-on-identifiers[Jinja identifiers].

Since ue4-docker version 0.0.78, the xref:ue4-docker-build.adoc[ue4-docker build] command supports a flag called `--opt` that allows users to directly set the context values passed to the underlying https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/[Jinja templating engine] used to generate Dockerfiles.
Some of these options (such as `source_mode`) can only be used when <<exporting-generated-dockerfiles,exporting generated Dockerfiles>>, whereas others can be used with the regular ue4-docker build process. **Note that incorrect use of these options can break build behaviour, so only use an option if you have read through both this documentation and the ue4-docker source code itself and understand exactly what that option does.** The following options are supported as of the latest version of ue4-docker:

- **`source_mode`**: *(string)* controls how the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-source[ue4-source] Dockerfile obtains the source code for the Unreal Engine.
Valid options are:

- `git`: the default mode, whereby the Unreal Engine source code is cloned from a git repository.
This is the only mode that can be used when not <<exporting-generated-dockerfiles,exporting generated Dockerfiles>>.

- `copy`: copies the Unreal Engine source code from the host filesystem.
The filesystem path can be specified using the `SOURCE_LOCATION` Docker build argument, and of course must be a child path of the build context.

- **`credential_mode`**: *(string)* controls how the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-source[ue4-source] Dockerfile securely obtains credentials for authenticating with remote git repositories when `source_mode` is set to `git`.
Valid options are:

- `endpoint`: the default mode for Windows Containers, whereby ue4-docker exposes an HTTP endpoint that responds with credentials when presented with a randomly-generated security token, which is injected into the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-source[ue4-source] container during the build process by way of a Docker build argument.
This mode will not work when <<exporting-generated-dockerfiles,exporting generated Dockerfiles>>, since the credential endpoint will not be available during the build process.

- `secrets`: **(Linux containers only)** default mode for Linux Containers, uses https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information[BuildKit build secrets] to securely inject the git credentials into the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-source[ue4-source] container during the build process.

- **`buildgraph_args`**: *(string)* allows you to specify additional arguments to pass to the https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProductionPipelines/BuildTools/AutomationTool/BuildGraph/index.html[BuildGraph system] when creating an Installed Build of the Unreal Engine in the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-minimal[ue4-minimal] image.

- **`disable_labels`**: *(boolean)* prevents ue4-docker from applying labels to built container images.
This includes the labels which specify the <<exclude-components,components excluded from the ue4-minimal image>> as well as the sentinel labels that the xref:ue4-docker-clean.adoc[ue4-docker clean] command uses to identify container images, and will therefore break the functionality of that command.

- **`disable_all_patches`**: *(boolean)* disables all the patches that ue4-docker ordinarily applies to the Unreal Engine source code.
This is useful when building a custom fork of the Unreal Engine to which the appropriate patches have already been applied, **but will break the build process when used with a version of the Unreal Engine that requires one or more patches**.
It is typically safer to disable individual patches using the specific flag for each patch instead of simply disabling everything:

- **`disable_release_patches`**: *(boolean)* disables the patches that ue4-docker ordinarily applies to versions of the Unreal Engine which are known to contain bugs, such as Unreal Engine 4.25.4. This will obviously break the build process when building these known broken releases, but will have no effect when building other versions of the Unreal Engine.

- **`disable_windows_setup_patch`**: *(boolean)* prevents ue4-docker from patching `Setup.bat` under Windows to comment out the calls to the Unreal Engine prerequisites installer and UnrealVersionSelector, both of which are known to cause issues during the build process for Windows containers.

- **`disable_linker_fixup`**: *(boolean)* prevents ue4-docker from replacing the linker in the Unreal Engine's bundled toolchain with a symbolic link to the system linker under Linux.

- **`disable_example_platform_cleanup`**: *(boolean)* prevents ue4-docker from removing the `Engine/Platforms/XXX` directory that was introduced in Unreal Engine 4.24.0 and subsequently removed in Unreal Engine 4.26.0. This directory represents a "dummy" target platform for demonstration purposes, and the presence of this directory will typically break the build process.

- **`disable_ubt_patches`**: *(boolean)* disables the patches that ue4-docker ordinarily applies to fix bugs in UnrealBuildTool (UBT) under various versions of the Unreal Engine.

- **`disable_opengl_patch`**: *(boolean)* prevents ue4-docker from attempting to re-enable the OpenGL RHI under Linux for versions of the Unreal Engine in which it is present but deprecated.

- **`disable_buildgraph_patches`**: *(boolean)* disables the patches that ue4-docker ordinarily applies to the BuildGraph XML files used to create an Installed Build of the Unreal Engine.
These patches fix various bugs under both Windows and Linux across multiple versions of the Unreal Engine.

- **`disable_target_patches`**: *(boolean)* disables the patches that ue4-docker ordinarily applies to fix broken `PlatformType` fields for client and server targets in `BaseEngine.ini` under Unreal Engine versions where these values are set incorrectly.

- **`disable_unrealpak_copy`**: *(boolean)* prevents ue4-docker from ensuring the UnrealPak tool is correctly copied into Installed Builds of the Unreal Engine under Linux.
Some older versions of the Unreal Engine did not copy this correctly, breaking the functionality of created Installed Builds.

- **`disable_toolchain_copy`**: *(boolean)* prevents ue4-docker from ensuring the bundled clang toolchain is correctly copied into Installed Builds of the Unreal Engine under Linux.
Some older versions of the Unreal Engine did not copy this correctly, breaking the functionality of created Installed Builds.

== Windows-specific options

[[windows-base-tag]]
=== Specifying the Windows Server Core base image tag

NOTE: The `-basetag` flag controls how the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-build-prerequisites[ue4-build-prerequisites] image is built and tagged, which has a flow-on effect to all the other images.
If you are building multiple related images over separate invocations of the build command (e.g. building the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-source[ue4-source] image in one command and then subsequently building the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-minimal[ue4-minimal] image in another command), be sure to specify the same `-basetag` flag each time to avoid unintentionally building two sets of unrelated images with different configurations.

By default, Windows container images are based on the Windows Server Core release that best matches the version of the host operating system.
However, Windows containers cannot run a newer kernel version than that of the host operating system, rendering the latest images unusable under older versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server.
(See the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility[Windows Container Version Compatibility] page for a table detailing which configurations are supported.)

If you are building images with the intention of subsequently running them under an older version of Windows 10 or Windows Server, you will need to build images based on the same kernel version as the target system (or older.) The kernel version can be specified by providing the appropriate base OS image tag via the `-basetag=TAG` flag when invoking the build command:

[source,shell]
----
ue4-docker build 4.20.3 -basetag=ltsc2016 # Uses Windows Server 2016 (Long Term Support Channel)
----

For a list of supported base image tags, see the https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore/[Windows Server Core base image on Docker Hub].

[[windows-isolation-mode]]
=== Specifying the isolation mode under Windows

The isolation mode can be explicitly specified via the `-isolation=MODE` flag when invoking the build command.
Valid values are `process` (supported under Windows Server and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/faq#can-i-run-windows-containers-in-process-isolated-mode-on-windows-10-enterprise-or-professional[Windows 10 version 1809 or newer]) or `hyperv` (supported under both Windows 10 and Windows Server.) If you do not explicitly specify an isolation mode then the appropriate default for the host system will be used.

=== Specifying Visual Studio Build Tools version under Windows

=== Keeping or excluding Installed Build debug symbols under Windows

WARNING: Excluding debug symbols is necessary under some versions of Docker as a workaround for a bug that limits the amount of data that a `COPY` directive can process to 8GB.
See xref:troubleshooting-build-issues.adoc#copy-8gb-20gb[this section of the Troubleshooting Build Issues page] for further details on this issue.

Prior to version 0.0.30, ue4-docker defaulted to truncating all `.pdb` files when building the Installed Build for the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-minimal[ue4-minimal] Windows image.
This was done primarily to address the bug described in the warning alert above, and also had the benefit of reducing the overall size of the built container images.
However, if you required the debug symbols for producing debuggable builds, you had to opt to retain all `.pdb` files by specifying the `--keep-debug` flag when invoking the build command.
(This flag was removed in ue4-docker version 0.0.30, when the default behaviour was changed and replaced with a more generic, cross-platform approach.)

Since ue4-docker version 0.0.30, debug symbols are kept intact by default, and can be removed by using the `--exclude debug` flag as described in the section <<exclude-components,Excluding Engine components to reduce the final image size>>.

=== Building Linux container images under Windows

By default, Windows container images are built when running the build command under Windows.
To build Linux container images instead, simply specify the `--linux` flag when invoking the build command.

== Linux-specific options

[[cuda]]
=== Enabling CUDA support for GPU-enabled Linux images

IMPORTANT: The `--cuda` flag controls how the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-build-prerequisites[ue4-build-prerequisites] image is built and tagged, which has a flow-on effect to all the other images.
If you are building multiple related images over separate invocations of the build command (e.g. building the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-source[ue4-source] image in one command and then subsequently building the xref:available-container-images.adoc#ue4-minimal[ue4-minimal] image in another command), be sure to specify the same `--cuda` flag each time to avoid unintentionally building two sets of unrelated images with different configurations.

By default, the Linux images built by ue4-docker support hardware-accelerated OpenGL when run via the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
If you would like CUDA support in addition to OpenGL support, simply specify the `--cuda` flag when invoking the build command.

You can also control the version of the CUDA base image that is used by appending a version number when specifying the `--cuda` flag, as demonstrated below:

[source,shell]
----
# Uses the default CUDA base image (currently CUDA 9.2)
ue4-docker build RELEASE --cuda
----

[source,shell]
----
# Uses the CUDA 10.0 base image
ue4-docker build RELEASE --cuda=10.0
{% endhighlight %}
----

For a list of supported CUDA versions, see the list of Ubuntu 18.04 image tags for the https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/[nvidia/cuda] base image.
